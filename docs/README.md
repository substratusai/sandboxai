# SandboxAI

*Unleash your AI agents ... in a box!*

SandboxAI is an open source runtime for executing AI-generated Python code and shell commands inside dynamic containers.

* **Flexible control**
  * Full-agency - Set the agent loose within the container
  * Limited-agency - Give the agent access to specific commands
* **Container based**
  * You define the environment
  * Integrate with existing tooling
* **Pluggable backends**
  * Run on your local machine or a remote VM
  * Run on your Kubernetes cluster (coming soon)
* **Open REST API**
  * Use the official Python or Go client
  * Generate your own client from the API spec

## Where does it fit?
